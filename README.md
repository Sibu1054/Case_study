This project demonstrates a standard machine learning workflow for a binary classification task.
The goal is to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic measurements using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset available in Scikit-learn.
This project serves as a practical example showcasing core data science skills often required for internships, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and basic visualization.
